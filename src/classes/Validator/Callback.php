/**
 * Uses a given callback to validate a value

 * The callback is invoked with one argument, which is the value being validated.
 * The result of the callback will be used as the error message for the validator.
 * Different types of return values will be treated different ways:
 *
 * Arrays and traversable objects will be converted to arrays, flattened, stringized
 * and compacted. Anything left will be considered an error message. If it turns
 * out empty, validation will pass
 *
 * Strings, Boolean, Null, False, Integers and Floats will be converted to strings.
 * If they are considered empty according to the "isEmpty" standards, the value
 * will pass validation. Otherwise, the string value will be used as the error message.
