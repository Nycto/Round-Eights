--------------------
Installing RaindropPHP
--------------------

RaindropPHP comes in two flavours, the raw source files and the single file PHP
archive. Both are equivilent as far as functionality is concerned.


--------------------------
Installing the PHP archive
--------------------------

Included in your download is RaindropPHP.phar. If you choose this path, this file
is all you need. Simply copy it to your chosen destination, and include it like
you would any other file, for example:

<?php
require_once "/path/to/RaindropPHP.phar";
?>

For more information about phar files, visit the PHP manual here:

http://www.php.net/phar


---------------------------
Installing the Source Files
---------------------------

Optionally, you may simply copy the "src" directory and all of its contents to
your code base, and include the contained "RaindropPHP.php" file, for example:

<?php
require_once "/path/to/src/RaindropPHP.php";
?>


------------
Requirements
------------

RaindropPHP requires version 5.3 or later of PHP. There are a few components that
require specific PHP extensions.
